Ashes Suite Collection
----------------------

This is the collection of programs that we use at the Sable Research Group to 
develop and test our compilers.  It is a set of freely redistributable benchmarks
which have the following properties:

- Freely redistributable and optimizable (allows reverse-engineering)

- Be non-interactive and windowless

- Be deterministic

- Run under jdk1.2

Benchmark organization
----------------------
All the benchmarks are organized in the following manner:

benchmark/classes      classfiles for the benchmark
benchmark/src          source files for the benchmark
benchmark/run*         script to execute the benchmark under Unix
benchmark/mainClass    file containing the name of the root class of the
                       benchmark

possibly some additional files

This benchmark could not be compiled due to the inherent
limitations of Javassist's source-based instrumentation,
before the Class object being passed to the method
traverseStaticsOnClassLoad was created using reflection
(Class.forName).

The problem is the use of the class name
'boolean' in the benchmark which is legal in Java
bytecode but an illegal identifier in Java. In particular
Javassist does not provide any kind of automatic (roundtrip)
translation into a valid Java identifier that can be used
in the instrumentation source code.

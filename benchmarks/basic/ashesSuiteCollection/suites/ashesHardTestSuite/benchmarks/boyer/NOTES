Cannot be instrumented with javassist due to incopatible version
of javac that generates the follow sequence for constructor S(i)

         0: aload_0
         1: iload_1
         2: aload_0
         3: invokespecial #14                 // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
         6: putfield      #13                 // Field $:I
         9: return

in constract to

         0: aload_0
         1: invokespecial #1                  // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
         4: aload_0
         5: iload_1
         6: putfield      #2                  // Field $:I
         9: return

that is being generated by current compilers.
